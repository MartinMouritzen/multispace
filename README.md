A Node based multiplayer space game.

Still in early developments, but should serve as a decent foundation for someone starting.

## How to run

npm install
npm start
then direct your browser to http://localhost:20001
```

## Just some future ideas
- Actually make ships destroy when reaching 0 health
- More sectors
- Make the AI shoot
- Trading with planets

Depending on the direction of the game
- Leaderboard
- Story
